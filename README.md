# Text-Mining-and-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Hotels-and-Restaurants-in-Phuket-Province-Thailand
Natural language is one of the main ways that humans produce data, making it a great source of knowledge that may be used. Sentiment analysis, a machine learning technique classifies the emotions or viewpoints expressed in sentiment data to identify whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. Examples of these emotions include happiness, anger, and anticipation. It might appear in the text, a paragraph, a sentence, or a clause. 
Text mining and sentiment analysis was performed in python to gain insight from the reviews of 30 hotels in three selected areas across the three districts of Phuket province. Based on their feedback, the reviews will be evaluated and mapped (positive or negative) and the top five and the least five hotels/restaurant in Phuket province (based on their reviews) was examined.
